If this appeals to you, continue reading for a longer text about working at Silverfin and your role 👇 At Silverfin, we're an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. Although we know we’re not perfect yet, we are working hard on it and always open for your feedback. According to our vision to build a diverse, equitable and inclusive organisation, our policy is to only make a final hiring decision if underrepresented groups are sufficiently represented in the list of candidates applying for the position. For this reason it’s possible interviews get slightly delayed until we’ve reached that goal. We're committed to elevating talent by creating an environment where we can all thrive together. So if you think you have what it takes, but don't necessarily check every single box, please consider applying. We'd love to hear how you might contribute to our mission and our team. What can we offer you? Actual, proper work-life balance Flexible working hours and work 100% remotely Personal growth training and opportunities Join a distributed remote-first engineering team with 40 colleagues in 14 different countries on two continents A refreshing work environment with professional, friendly and welcoming colleagues A €1200 yearly budget for conferences, courses, workshops or other expenses that will improve your skills Two engineering retreats per year, somewhere in Europe Ten company-wide Wellbeing Days per year for all employees (once a month, except in July and August) Compensation For this role, the salary range is €104.000 - €130.000 a year , which reflects the total compensation band for senior engineers at this level. Please note: Most candidates start at the lower to mid part of the range, depending on experience and how their profile compares to our existing team. The higher end of the range is typically offered to individuals with a track record of strong impact and deep expertise in similar roles. We run annual compensation reviews, so there is clear opportunity for growth as you progress in the role. What will you work on? Building and maintaining integrations with accountancy software packages and APIs Figure out the best way to solve a customer or business problem in close collaboration with a product manager, a product designer and other engineers Improving and expanding our on-premise Ruby CLI/service which runs on hundreds of our customer’s systems Work on user facing functionalities What are we looking for? You’re experienced in both Ruby and Rails, and also understand where the boundaries lie between them. You can code in Ruby without any of Rails’ training wheels if necessary. You have experience using Javascript framework(s), understand the value of them, but also know when plain Javascript is enough. You enjoy integrating with APIs and aren’t easily dissuaded when encountering unreliable or poorly documented systems. You code with reason and can justify the important decisions you made during development. You can communicate clearly in English, both in writing and verbally. You’re up for mentoring coworkers and can give in-depth, productive feedback during code reviews. While you appreciate the small stuff, you recognise bike-shedding and can avoid its pitfalls. You know and can apply best practices when relevant. That means the usual like version control, testing, and refactoring; but also higher level concepts such as good object oriented design. You're aware of the trade-offs involved in proper engineering and can make balanced business decisions, keeping in mind all the stakeholders of the project. You’ve got opinions on code design and you can discuss them, but you’re professional enough to not let those opinions get in the way of a consensus if necessary. What’s a Silverfin? At Silverfin we’re trying to apply the promise of software to the age-old industry of accounting. With our SaaS we’re automating a large chunk of the busy-work that accountants are currently handling manually, and are building new tools so they can provide better services to their customers. We aim to optimise their workflow in such a way that accountants can spend more time on the much more impactful and rewarding work of advising their customers, the business owners. The good news is we’re succeeding in doing exactly that. Every week more than 15.000 financial service professionals use Silverfin to help and advise more than 400.000 businesses. Our customers adore us! The even better news is there’s still plenty left to work on, and that’s where we hope you come in. Since November 2023 we are proudly part of Visma - the European leader in mission-critical cloud software, enjoying the power of the Visma brand and resources whilst retaining business autonomy and go-to-market freedom. What’s Team Syncs? One of the cornerstones of the Silverfin platform is the integration with bookkeeping packages that accountants already work with, which allows us to seamlessly import their accounting data. We currently have integrations with over 40 different vendors, and we want to add more as we expand to different markets. Team Syncs is the team responsible for creating, maintaining and improving these integrations. Our challenge is to build robust integrations, although sometimes the APIs we need to use are poorly designed, badly documented or even unreliable. Yet solving those puzzles, and empowering our customers by importing gigabytes of data from their clunky bookkeeping software, makes it all worth it. Because once the data is in Silverfin, it's connected, standardised and can be easily worked with, which is what it's all about. If you're a tinkerer, love working with APIs and thrive in the face of uncertainty, this might be for you. The accounting data imported by these integrations is held in the biggest domain-focused table we are having. On top of this data the computations are performed so you will have a challenge of implementing solutions which need to have performance in mind. What are the things you'll be working on? Improve the stability, performance and infrastructure cost of dozens of our current 3rd party integrations, through usage of different distributed systems patterns Rare opportunity to work on a CLI/service application which is currently deployed on hundreds of our customers' servers Extend existing integrations to fetch new kinds of data. Figure out the structure which will be the most maintainable and generalized throughout variety of our integrations What does your future look like? Personal growth is key to staying motivated. At Silverfin you don’t need to move to management in order to advance. We see the individual contributor track and the management track as two different growth paths which every engineer can follow and switch between. You can be promoted, including pay raises, as a contributor just like as a manager. Everyone has a €1200 yearly budget to spend on conferences, courses, workshops or other training to improve their skills and level up. This also includes accommodation, travel costs. If the conference is on a workday you’ll get paid like any normal day. Requirements You have at least 4 years of experience working with Ruby, or 2 years of experience with Ruby and 4 years in one or more other programming languages You have experience with Javascript framework(s) You have experience with designing or integrating with APIs Your work hours have some overlap with EU business hours (we require your local timezone to be within CET +/- 3h) You can communicate clearly in English, both written and verbally Nice to haves These would be nice but are definitely not necessary.
